If you run a simple calculation of your energy expense for a period of one year, you'll identify well with the above caption.

Let's look at this together. Your cost of lighting up your home for a year.

Generator purchase N120,000 (depending on brand and capacity)

Routine maintenance N7,000 X 12 = N84,000

Daily fuel/gas N1,500 X 30 = N45,000 X 12 = N540,000

Total N744,000

Environmental and noise pollution = medical bills.

The above simple calculation is what it costs an average person in Nigeria and others in some Africa counties to power their homes for few hours each day (not 24/7) for a year.

NOW THE DISRUPTION 

It costs less than what is spent a year on traditional power generating sets to install a renewable energy system (solar) that can power a home for 24 hours, uninterrupted, for the next 25 years.

In connection with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 7 (SDG#7), Hakuna Tech Ltd is positioned to save the planet, light up communities and support SMEs.
