Since establishment in 2019, Hakuna Tech Ltd has assumed an optimistic posture towards mutually beneficial partnerships with goal-oriented organizations because, as Mark Parker put it, ***"The biggest sources of opportunity are collaboration and partnership".*** Strategic partnerships can be a catalyst in qualitative service delivery in almost every industry.

A milestone in our timeline was reached on thursday, July 1, 2021 when advanced talks were held with a representative of **[Felicity Solar](https://www.felicitysolar.com/)** over a partnership between both companies. Chinese Energy Tech giants, Felicity solar have carved a niche for themselves in the solar energy industry as experts in the design and development of solar products and equipment.

Both parties are confident that a concrete agreement will be reached within the next couple of weeks. Speaking at the meeting, Mr Jimmy, Felicity Solar's representative while commending HTL's management for taking giant strides in the drive towards providing clean energy for the African populace, also expressed satisfaction at the symbiotic nature of the partnership being proposed.

This partnership will enable HTL deliver quality solar energy systems to our customers at affordable costs. To celebrate this deal, plans will be made to slash the prices on some of our installation packages. Meanwhile, here's a short video displaying our **[PRODUCT BROCHURE.](https://fb.watch/v/aDw_fdr5J/)**

We believe that the deal with Felicity Solar will be a springboard to cementing our place as Africa's leading renewable energy company.
