### Intergrity

Honesty remains the best policy. 

We plan and build solar systems that translate performance and reliability into integrity, making sure that value for money is guaranteed.

### Diligence

Passion for excellence is the driving force behind our consistency and resilience in service delivery and development of value chain in the application of renewable energy in various needs and niches. 

At Hakuna Tech, sustainable energy  means harvesting renewable energy  in sustainable ways, based on understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between the sun, prevailing weather conditions and solar equipment... these are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
